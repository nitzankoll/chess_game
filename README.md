# Chess Game with Graphics

This project is a fully functional chess game with graphics. It includes a main executable to play the game and a graphics engine to render the chessboard.

## How to Use

1. **Download both `.exe` files** (`chess_game.exe` and `chessGraphics.exe`) from the [Releases](https://github.com/nitzankoll/chess_game/releases) section of the repository.
2. **Place both `.exe` files in the same project folder** where the source files (`.cpp` and `.h`) are located.
   - Both `chess_game.exe` and `chessGraphics.exe` must be in the same directory for proper functionality.
3. Run `chess_game.exe` to start the game.


## Building from Source

If you prefer to build the project from source, follow the steps below:

1. Open the project solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution to compile `chess_game.exe` and `chessGraphics.exe`.
3. Place both `.exe` files in the same directory as the source files.
4. Run `chess_game.exe` to start the game.

### Important Note:

Even if you build the solution from source, you still need the `chessGraphics.exe` file in the project folder to run the game correctly. The `chessGraphics.exe` handles rendering the chessboard, and `chess_game.exe` relies on it for the graphical interface.

## Files Included

- **chess_game.exe**: The core executable for running the chess game.
- **chessGraphics.exe**: The graphics engine for rendering the chessboard.
- **.cpp** files: Source code for the chess game logic.
- **.h** files: Header files containing game logic declarations.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio or another C++ compiler with Windows API support is required to build from source.
